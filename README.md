# delta-development-thresholds
MATLAB scripts used in support of academic paper "Effects of tidal range and significant wave height on delta development".

These scripts were used to import and process Delft3D simulation data, as well as producing plots and animations related to the above manuscript.
When importing using dttMapImportDD.m or dttHistoryImportDD.m, select the 1st map file of the desired simulation (i.e. <trim*_01.dat> or <trih*_01.dat>).

Note that running these scripts will also require installation of the Delft3D-MATLAB toolkit.
